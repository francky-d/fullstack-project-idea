# Web Application Monitoring System - Project Overview

## üéØ What is this project about?

This is a **Web Application Monitoring System** that helps teams and individuals monitor the health and availability of their web applications. Think of it as a "watchdog" for your websites and APIs that:

- **Continuously monitors** your web applications by checking if they're responding correctly
- **Automatically detects issues** when your apps are down or returning unexpected responses
- **Creates incidents** to track problems from detection to resolution
- **Notifies team members** who are subscribed to monitoring alerts
- **Provides a collaborative platform** for managing application reliability

### Key Value Proposition
Instead of discovering your website is down when customers complain, this system proactively monitors your applications 24/7 and immediately alerts your team when issues occur, enabling faster response times and better user experience.

## üéØ Core Features Summary

This monitoring system provides **4 core capabilities**:

1. **Proactive Monitoring**: Continuously watches your applications and detects issues automatically
2. **Incident Tracking**: Manages problems from detection through resolution with a clear workflow
3. **Team Collaboration**: Enables teams to subscribe to applications and stay informed about issues
4. **Historical Visibility**: Maintains records of application reliability and incident patterns

The system is designed to be **technology-agnostic** and can be implemented using any modern web framework (Laravel, Django, Express.js, Spring Boot, etc.) while maintaining the same core functionality and user experience.
